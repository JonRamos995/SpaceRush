# Space Rush: Idle Trading Empire

## Game Overview
Space Rush is a captivating sci-fi incremental game where you begin as the captain of a humble basic spaceship and rise to become the CEO of an intergalactic trading monopoly.

The game combines idle mechanics with strategic resource management. Your fleet works for you even when you are offline, harvesting resources from the cosmos. Your job is to manage the economics, upgrade your technology, and expand your reach across the galaxy.

## The Goal
**To build a self-sustaining, ever-expanding trading empire that monopolizes the galaxy's resources.**

We aim to create an experience that is:
*   **Super Fun to Play**: Satisfying progression, crisp visuals, and rewarding feedback loops.
*   **Always Fresh**: New technologies, rare resources, and mysterious sectors unlock as you progress, ensuring there is always something new to discover.

## Core Gameplay Loop

1.  **Harvest**: Your ships automatically mine resources (Iron, Gold, Platinum, etc.) from asteroids and planets.
2.  **Trade**: The `TradingSystem` monitors the galactic market. Prices fluctuate, allowing for strategic selling or automated profit generation.
3.  **Upgrade**: Use your Credits to upgrade your `FleetManager`.
    *   **Ship Level**: Increase mining speed.
    *   **Cargo Capacity**: Hold more resources before needing to sell.
    *   **New Tech**: Unlock automation and faster engines.
4.  **Expand**: As your wealth grows, you unlock new sectors of space with more valuable resources (Diamonds, Antimatter).

## Key Features

*   **Idle Progression**: Your empire grows 24/7. The `IdleManager` calculates your gains while you were away, so you always return to a massive haul.
*   **Dynamic Market**: Resource values aren't static. Capitalize on market spikes to maximize profits.
*   **Infinite Scaling**: From a single ship to a massive armada, the numbers—and the excitement—only go up.
