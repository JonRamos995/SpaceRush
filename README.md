# Space Rush: Idle Trading Empire

## Game Overview
Space Rush is a sci-fi incremental game where you begin as a survivor on a damaged ship grounded on Earth. From these humble beginnings, you will repair your vessel, expand to the stars, and build an intergalactic trading empire that elevates humanity to a new civilization level.

## The Goal
**Start from zero, repair your ship, and monopolize the galaxy's resources to advance civilization.**

## The Narrative Arc
1.  **Survival (Earth)**: You start with 0 credits and a broken ship. You must scrape together funds (or wait for slow repairs) to get your systems online.
2.  **Expansion (Solar System)**: Once operational, you travel to the Moon and Mars, mining basic resources like Iron and Gold.
3.  **Industrialization (Asteroid Belt)**: Unlock the rich mineral fields of the Asteroid Belt to fuel your growing economy.
4.  **Advancement**: Hire researchers and invest in technology. Your discoveries don't just help you mine faster; they transform the world, increasing the "Civilization Level" and unlocking new possibilities.

## Core Gameplay Loop

1.  **Repair & Prepare**: In the early game, focus on getting your ship to 100% integrity.
2.  **Harvest**: Automatically mine resources based on your current location (`LocationManager`). Earth offers little, but the Moon and Mars are rich in minerals.
3.  **Trade**: The `TradingSystem` sells your goods. Use the market to fund your operations.
4.  **Research**: Use the `ResearchManager` to hire scientists. Unlock "Mining Efficiency", "Advanced Propulsion", and "Terraforming" to progress.
5.  **Upgrade**: Improve your `FleetManager` stats to carry more cargo and travel to distant sectors.

## Key Features

*   **Narrative Progression**: A clear path from a stranded pilot to a galactic CEO.
*   **Location System**: Different planets yield different resources. You must unlock travel to higher-tier locations.
*   **Research Tree**: Invest in the future. Unlocking tech is the key to exponential growth.
*   **Idle Mechanics**: Offline progress calculates your gains based on where you parked your ship.
